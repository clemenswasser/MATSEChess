# Matse Chess

MATSE Chess is a university project which was created for the [C# course](https://www.matse.itc.rwth-aachen.de/dienste/public/index.php?m=wiki&p=Lehrveranstaltungen/Wahlpflichtmodule/WP_Programmiersprachen/CSharp).

We used WPF for our UI, unfortunately this project supports Windows only.

## Setup Instructions

You need .NET 6.0 and Visual Studio 2022 to open the `.sln` file in the root directory of this project. Simply open the solution and hit run!

## Downloading a release

We've created a GitHub release which includes the release binaries ([Link](https://github.com/clemenswasser/MATSEChess/releases)).
